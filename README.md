## Lyrics

```
leadin' home
gonna fight it all, pullin' back
leadin' home, nagging ain't this
kinda land yeah

leadin' home
gonna puck it like a right up (pu- it laka raaayup)

- like it up fam
right out to the foreign lands 
lick'em from behind the glass 

we will close the deals as we made them for ya
tending the the herd will tire that's obvious
heard that you vowed never to erase them
your own lads but did it anyway yeah

to my guise




```
