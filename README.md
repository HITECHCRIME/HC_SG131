## Lyrics

```
leavin' home
gonna fight it all, pullin' back
lettin' go, nagging ain't this
kinda land yeah

leadin' home,
gonna puck it like a right up (pu- it laka raaayup)

- light it up fam
right out to the foreign lands 
bragga to the xxxxx downed
please make me prrrrroud
that means what it sounds
preachin' doin' so get to doin' just that

lick'em - behind the glass 
tease'em - still so crass
appease them leave ya will
at the stairs


we will close the deals as we made them for ya
tending the the herd will tire that's obvious
heard that you vowed never to erase them
your own lads but did it anyway yeah

to my guise


had a fallin' out





```
